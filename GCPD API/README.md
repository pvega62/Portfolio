# GCPD Detainee API

This API serves as an intermediary between the detainee database for the Gotham City Police Department and a proprietary interface created by WayneTech, with the encryption and API written by Barbara Gordon.

Only authorized administrative staff can add, delete, or edit a detainee's file. Other officers and staff can only create read-only calls to the API. Contact Barbara Gordon (ext. 809) or Commissioner James Gordon (ext.027) to receive administrative privileges.
