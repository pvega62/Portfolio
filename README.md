# Welcome to my Portfolio,
This is my portfolio showcasing various technical writing projects, including API documentation, installation guides, and user manuals. 

Each piece demonstrates my ability to create clear and concise documentation tailored to the needs of the target audience.

To view an example of my work in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, visit the [Recordkeeping Site](https://pvega62.github.io/Recordkeeping/) or check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pvega62/Recordkeeping). Recordkeeping is a website I designed to keep track of my record collection, it includes the ability to listen to a featured track by clicking on the album cover.
