# Welcome to my portfolio

With over a decade of cross-industry experience, the majority of my work has always centered around demystifying complex concepts and making them accessible to the wider audience. This was my goal as a tutor, a journalist, and it remains my goal as a technical writer and UX writer.

This portfolio showcases technical writing projects, including API documentation, installation guides, and user manuals. For those samples, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/pvega62/Portfolio/wiki) section.

Each piece demonstrates the ability to create clear and concise documentation tailored to the needs of the target audience.

To view samples of my UX Writing, visit my [UX Writing Portfolio](https://github.com/pvega62/UX-Writing-Portfolio).

To view an example of my work in HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap CSS, visit the [Recordkeeping Site](https://pvega62.github.io/Recordkeeping/) or check out the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/pvega62/Recordkeeping). Recordkeeping, a website designed to keep track of a record collection, includes the ability to listen to a featured track by clicking on the album cover.
