# Welcome to my portfolio
This portfolio showcases technical writing projects, including API documentation, installation guides, and user manuals. For those samples, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/pvega62/Portfolio/wiki) section.

Each piece demonstrates the ability to create clear and concise documentation tailored to the needs of the target audience.

To view an example of work in HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap CSS, visit the [Recordkeeping Site](https://pvega62.github.io/Recordkeeping/) or check out the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/pvega62/Recordkeeping). Recordkeeping, a website designed to keep track of a record collection, includes the ability to listen to a featured track by clicking on the album cover.

You can also view an HTML version of a résumé, created with HTML and basic CSS, [here](https://pvega62.github.io/Resume/) or check out the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/pvega62/Resume).
