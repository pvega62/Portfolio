          <p>I am a multidisciplinary writer with experience in creative, technical, and UX writing and journalism. I also have experience in publishing and tech (besides technical writing). Though my career has taken me through various industries, the common thread in all my roles has been the need to convey complex ideas and concepts in a way that the average person can understand.</p>

          <p>As an English tutor, I also helped students of various age groups learn to break down complex ideas and interpret them in their own unique way. I also used the same skill as a journalist, familiarizing myself with complex topics like medical technology and COVID-19, and relaying that information using accessible language.</p> 

          <p>I dedicated a large chunk of my time at the Borgen Project to writing a series of articles about sociopolitical issues in the Dominican Republic, ranging from gender equality to poverty and healthcare. As a Dominican-American, the plight of my ancestral homeland will always be near and dear to my heart. But so are the plights of my brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico, which is why I also wrote about how hurricanes and the COVID-19 Pandemic exacerbated hunger on the island of Borinquen. In the editorial department of a publishing house, the same idea is still at play, but this time, it’s more like a guiding hand helping them craft and disseminate those ideas.</p>

          <p>My first job out of college was as a technician at the New York City College of Technology. As anyone with IT support experience can attest to, a good chunk of the job is walking people through the steps necessary to resolve their technical problems. Fast-forward a decade later, and my role as a technical writer is an elevated form of that concept.</p>

          <p>Outside the office, I like to quip that the job is just translating “technobabble” into English. However, there is, like in all great jokes, a kernel of truth to it. The high-level concepts at play in the engineering process can sound like another language to the layperson. In that regard, I also view my role as that of a translator, which is nothing new to me.</p>

          <p>Any child of an immigrant family can tell you that the role of translator is one bestowed upon you at a very young age. We have been translating English and legalese to our families since we learned to read, so why not make a career out of it?</p>
